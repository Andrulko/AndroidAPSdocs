# Freestyle Libre 1

To use your Libre as a CGM that is getting new BG values every 5 minutes without having to scan the sensor, you need to buy an NFC to Bluetooth bridge (commercially available devices, based on the obsolete [LimiTTer](https://github.com/JoernL/LimiTTer) project).

:::{admonition} Libre 1 US and Libre Pro :class: warning Verify the bridge you want to use is compatible with the sensor  
:::

Several bridges are available on the market:

-   [MiaoMiao Reader](https://www.miaomiao.cool/) (version 1, 2 or 3) also available on AliExpress.
-   [Blucon Nightrider](https://www.ambrosiasys.com/our-products/blucon/) (mind recent firmware versions might not be compatible with all apps, the vendor app does not broadcast data to AAPS)
-   [Bubble (or Bubble Mini)](https://www.bubblesmartreader.com/) from European vendors ([Bubblan](https://www.bubblan.org/), [BubbleShop](https://bubbleshop.eu/)) or for Russian users [here](https://vk.com/saharmonitor/). Also available on AliExpress.
-   Atom for Russian users.

Historically it is possible to use a specific watch, the Sony Smartwatch 3 (SWR50) which has an NFC chip that can be enabled and used as an NFC collector. However the custom NFC to Bluetooth bridges listed above offer a less complex solution and would be used by the majority of those wanting to use their Libre 1 (non-US) as a CGM.

As it currently stands, if using Libre 1 as BG source you cannot activate ‘Enable SMB always’ and ‘Enable SMB after carbs’ within the SMB algorithm. The BG values of Libre 1 are not smooth enough to use it safely. See [Smoothing blood glucose data](../Usage/Smoothing-Blood-Glucose-Data-in-xDrip.md) for more details.
