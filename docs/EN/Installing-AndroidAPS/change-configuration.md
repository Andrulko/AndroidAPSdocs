# change configuration

After you completed the setup wizard you don't need to run it again if you want to change only parts of the configuration.

You have got three choices too change the configuration depending on which level you want to change the configuration. All three choices change the same configuration. You can take the choice you want to every time.

1. config builder,
1. three dot menu on the right and select "preferences" and
1. three dot menu on the right and select "plugin preferences".

Here we explain which option to use best for which use case.

## config builder

The config builder is used if you want to enable plugins and their visibility in the top level menu. You can decide on the visibilty itself because some plugins visibilty is not important for you though you can disable the visibilty.

Disabled plugins can not be made visible as this makes no sense at all.

You can see it as the base configurator after you used the setup wizard.

The documentation of the config builder is available [here](../Configuration/Config-Builder.md).

## preferences

The preferences dialog is  called via the top right three dot menu on the home screen of AAPS. It gives you the possibilty to change the configuration of all enabled plugins at once.

This is nice if you are not really shure where to look for an configuration option but a bit tedious if you know you want to change the configuration for just one plugin.

The documentation of the preferences is available [here](../Configuration/Preferences.md).


## plugin preferences

The plugin preferences dialog is  called via the top right three dot menu on the home screen of AAPS. It gives you the possibilty to change the configuration of all enabled plugins at once.

This is nice if you know that you e.g. just want to change the configuration for BYODA. Then you select the tab BYODA in the top level menu off AAPS and then select in the top right three dot menu the "plugin preferences" entry. You are placed directly in the preferences dialog for the BYODA plugin.

As this is a short cut of the general preferences dialog the documentation of the preferences is available [here](../Configuration/Preferences.md).
