# configuring the AAPS loop

When you first start AAPS you are guided through the setup wizward to setup the basic configuration.

It's not mandatory to get all things configured in the first run as
- you can always go back to the setup wizard or
- change only relevant part of the configuration in a direct approach the relevant part.

Though please relax if your are setting up AAPS the first time and expect that you might ask the community for help to answer some of your questions.

Even writers of the documentation themselves had to setup AAPS and decided to joint the documentation team to bring their experiences back to improve the documenation for other new starters.

## setup wizard

Please follow the documentation for the setup wizard [here](./setup-wizard.md).
