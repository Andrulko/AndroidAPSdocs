# Transferring, and Installing AAPS on your smartphone

In the previous section, [building **AAPS**](../building-AAPS.md), you built the **AAPS** app (which is an .apk file) on a computer. 

The next steps are to transfer the **AAPS** APK file (and other apps you may need, like BYODA, Xdrip+ or another CGM reciever app) to your Android smartphone and then install the app. 

Following installation of **AAPS** on the smartphone, you will then be able to move onto [**configuring the AAPS loop**](configuring-the-AAPS-loop.md).

There are several ways to transfer the **AAPS** APK file from your computer to the smartphone. Here we explain two different ways: 

* Option 1-  Use a USB cable
* Option 2 -  Use your Google drive (Gdrive)

The easiest way is with a USB cable, moving the file from the computer to the "downloads" folder on the phone. 

You can also use your **Google Drive** to do the transfer and installation. By using **Google Drive**, you automatically have a **backup copy** of the apk file, which will be very useful if you lose or break your computer or smartphone.

Once you have transferred the AAPS apk as well as the app you intend to use for receiving your CGM data (BYODA, Xdrip+ or ..Juggulo), to your Android phone, you can proceed to the next section, installing AAPS. 

## 1. Transfer using a USB cable

A Gmail account provides access to free cloud storage from Gdrive which can be accessed directly as a “virtual” drive from both your PC AND your phone. You can use this feature to backup important settings/files in Gdrive and to share files between the phone and the PC.
If you have not done so already, install Gdrive on your PC: 



#### Install Google drive (“Gdrive”) on your PC as shown in this walk-through:

The steps are as follows: 

1. Go to <https://drive.google.com/> 

2. Use your new  “AAPS-dedicated” account to login, (if needed switch the account from the profile window)

3. From the gear icon next to your profile picture select “Get drive for desktop”  

4. Download & Install the Gdrive application on your PC

5. By default,Gdrive will appear on your PC as G:\My Drive, create 3 subfolders under My Drive:

   - AAPS\_APK  \
     (to store your own versions of the AAPS application as you build it and update it overtime)
   - AAPS\_CONFIG\_BACKUP\
     (where you will keep a backup of your AAPS phone configurations overtime)
   - AAPS\_SECRETS \
     (where you will keep passwords required to rebuild the application and facilitate updates over time)

6. It is advisable to share these folders with your significant others in case they need to re-access or re-build the app for you. 

   - (1) Right click on the folder 3 vertical dots menu
   - (2) Click Share 
   - (3) Click Share
