# Installing AAPS

In the previous section, [building **AAPS**](../building-AAPS.md), you built the **AAPS** app (which is an .apk file) on a computer. 

The next steps are to:

1. Transfer the **AAPS** APK file to your Android smartphone
   
  
2. Install the **AAPS** APK file on your Android smartphone

Following installation of **AAPS** on the smartphone, you will then be able to move onto [**configuring the AAPS loop**](configuring-the-AAPS-loop.md).
   
## 1. Transfer the **AAPS** APK file to your Android smartphone (using Google Drive)

There are several ways to transfer the **AAPS** APK file from your computer to the smartphone. The easiest way is with a USB cable, moving the file from the computer to the "downloads" folder on the phone. However, we recommend using your **Google Drive** to do the transfer instead. By using **Google Drive**, you automatically have a **backup copy** of the apk file, which will be very useful if you lose or break your computer or smartphone.

Step-by-step guide:

a) Open [Google.com](https://www.google.com/) in your web browser.

b) On the right upper side select the Drive app in the Google menu.

c) Right-click in the free area below the files and folders in the **Google Drive** app and select "Upload File".

d) The apk file should now be uploaded on Google Drive.

### 2. Install  the **AAPS** APK file on your Android smartphone (using Google Drive)

a) Switch to working on your Android smartphone, and start the **Google Drive** app, which should be preinstalled on the phone.

c) If you get a security notice that you are "not allowed to install apps from **Google Drive**", you will need to allow it while you are installing the app, and then disallow it afterwards to prevent it being a security risk.

d) Now that you have installed **AAPS** on the Android smartphone you should see the **AAPS** icon and be able to open the app. 

```{warning}
**IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTICE**

Did you remember to disallow the installation from Google Drive?
