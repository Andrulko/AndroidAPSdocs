# For users of Eversense

The easiest way to use Eversense with AAPS is to install the EU or US modified [Eversense app](https://cr4ck3d3v3r53n53.club/) (and uninstall the original one first).

**Warning: by uninstalling the old app, your local historical data older than one week will be lost!**

- To get your data to AAPS, you need to install [ESEL](https://github.com/BernhardRo/Esel/blob/master/apk/debug/app-debug.apk) and enable "Send to AAPS and xDrip", disable "Send to NightScout".

As the BG data from Eversense can be noisy sometimes, it is good to enable "Smooth Data" in ESEL, which is better than enabling "Always use short average delta instead of simple delta" in AAPS.

- Set "MM640g" as BG source in in [ConfigBuilder, BG Source](/Configuration/Config-Builder.md#bg-source).

You can find the instruction for using xDrip with an Eversense [here](https://github.com/BernhardRo/Esel/tree/master/apk).
